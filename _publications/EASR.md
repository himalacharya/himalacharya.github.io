## Abstract
Identifying anomalous motion behavior in video sequences is a challenging task. Manual annotation of a large number of surveillance videos  is  time-consuming  because  of  the  limited  human  brain's  visual  attention.  This  work  presents  a  new  framework  to  detect abnormalities from unlabeled videos using motion patterns for the normal and abnormal event. This paper proposedan unsupervised hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique for finding the abnormal behavior motion patterns. Dense trajectories of feature points were  extracted and grouped into feature  points for  different  interval groups with characteristics  of the feature  points' motion speed. With  results  from  partitioning interval  groups  by  hierarchical  clustering,  anomalous  motion  patterns  were  localized  in  surveillance video sequences. We performed experiments on publicly available datasets containing different abnormal samples. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieved the highest frame-level accuracy of 96.68% for the UMN dataset. The experiment has  achieved  the  highest  rate  of  detection  (up  to  98.63%)  for  UCSD  pedestrian  datasets. The  proposed  framework  has  achieved outstanding performance in both pixel level and frame level evaluation.
