## Abstract
Surveillance cameras are widely being used in public places for security and monitoring purposes. Detecting
abnormal motion pattern from surveillance video sequences is challenging task. Most of the existing methods
are based on supervised technique. Supervised method groups feature points into normal and abnormal
motion pattern using classifier. But anomalous event are contextual so this paper focuses on unsupervised
learning method of finding abnormal motion pattern. Contextual abnormality can not be detected by supervised
method in every surveillance video sequences. This proposed approach works without the need of training
phase. By extracting trajectory features by dense optical flow, speed of moving objects are taken into
consideration for unsupervised motion pattern in video sequences. K-means clustering approach is simple to
implement and computationally efficient. By applying such clustering method, dominant motion group and
anomalous group are well separated. Experimental results demonstrate this proposed approach outperforms
the state-of-art approaches on standard dataset.
